**Multithreading and concurrency**
___

This repository contains some code examples of multithreading and concurrency using Java.

The examples were inspired by the course [Java Multithreading, Concurrency & Performance Optimization](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-multithreading-concurrency-performance-optimization), but there were some modifications that I considered on my own and to adapt to the version of Java I used (17).
